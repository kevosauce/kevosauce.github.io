<h1>Welcome</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
Hello. My name is Kevin. I just finished a master's degree in physics at UChicago. In a previous life I worked in tech, at Genius, Twitter, and Apple. You can read more about my professional life on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinullmann" target=_blank>Linked In</a> . As for the personal stuff, I love dogs, am trying to improve my chess game, and have been known to pilot a paraglider named Daisy <small><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTw143UWWOk" target=_blank>(poorly&hellip;)</a></small>
</p>

<p>
You can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/kevosauce" target=_blank>@kevosauce</a>. I mostly tweet about politics, science, and religion, with the occassional RT for a cute animal or dumb joke.
