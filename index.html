<h1>Welcome</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
Hello. My name is Kevin. I recently joined Uber's Advanced Technology Group, where I am very excited to be writing software for autonomous trucks. Prior to joining ATG I earned a master's degree in physics at UChicago, and before that I worked for several years in app development, at Genius, Twitter, and Apple. You can read more about my professional life on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinullmann" target=_blank>Linked In</a>.
</p>

<p>
As for the personal stuff, I once traveled around the world, literally, flying from SF to NYC, traveling through Europe, the Middle East, India, then Japan and finally back across the Pacific. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBs2Z9p9rr0" target=_blank>Here's a silly video</a> about that. I love dogs, am trying to improve my chess game, and have been known to pilot a paraglider named Daisy <small><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTw143UWWOk" target=_blank>(poorly&hellip;)</a></small>
</p>

<p>
You can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/kevosauce" target=_blank>@kevosauce</a>. I mostly tweet about politics, science, and religion, with the occassional RT for a cute animal or dumb joke.
